"""
Modeling Features: Dataset Offsets
==================================

Multi-wavelength datasets often have offsets between their images, which are due to the different telescope pointings
during the observations.

These offsets are often accounted for during the data reduction process, which aligns the images, however:

 - Certain data reduction pipelines may not perfectly align the images, and the scientist may be unsure what the
 true offset between the images are.

 - Even if the reduction process does align the images, there is still a small uncertainty in the offset due to the
   precision of the telescope pointing which for detailed galaxy models must be accounted for.

This script shows how to include an offset in the model, which is two free parameters, the y and x offsets, for every
additional dataset after the first dataset. The offset therefore describes the offset of each dataset in the
multi-wavelength dataset relative to the first dataset.

To apply the offset, the code simply subtracts the offset from the grids aligned to the dataset pixels before performing
calculations. This means that the light and mass model centres do not change when the offset is applied, only
the coordinates of the image pixels which are input into these profiles to compute the images.

__Advantages__

If one fits a model to one dataset and applies it to other datasets, it is common to see the model fit degrade due to
small offsets between the datasets. The same issue persists for simultaneous fits to multiple datasets, even when
care has been taken to align the datasets.

The advantage is therefore simple, for most multi-wavelength modeling, accounting for offsets in this way
is the only way to ensure the model is accurate.

__Disadvantages__

Each offset introduces two additional free parameters into the model for each dataset after the first dataset. For
4 datasets, this is 6 additional free parameters. This increases the dimensionality of the non-linear parameter space
and therefore the computational run-time of the model-fit.

__Model__

This script fits multiple multi-wavelength `Imaging` datasets of a galaxy with a model where:

 - The galaxy's light is a linear parametric `Sersic` bulge and `Exponential` disk.

Two images are fitted, corresponding to a greener ('g' band) and redder image (`r` band).

__Colors__

The colors of the multi-wavelength image, which in this case are green (g-band) and red (r-band).

The strings are used for load each dataset.

__Pixel Scales__

Every multi-wavelength dataset can have its own unique pixel-scale.

"""
__Dataset__

Load and plot each multi-wavelength dataset, using a list of their waveband colors.

The plotted images show that the datasets have a small offset between them, half a pixel based on the resolution of
the second image.

"""
__Mask__

Define a 3.0" circular mask, which includes the emission of the galaxy.

For multi-wavelength modeling, we use the same mask for every dataset whenever possible. This is not
absolutely necessary, but provides a more reliable analysis.

The small offset between datasets means that the mask may not contain the exact same area of the image for every
dataset. 

For this dataset's offset of half a pixel (and anything of order a few pixels) this is fine and wont impact the analysis. 
However, for larger offsets the mask may need to be adjusted to ensure the same image area is masked out.

__Analysis__

We create an `Analysis` object for every dataset.
"""
analysis_list = [ag.AnalysisImaging(dataset=dataset) for dataset in dataset_list]

"""
__Model__

We compose our galaxy model using `Model` objects, which represent the galaxies we fit to our data. In this 
example we fit a galaxy model where:

 - The galaxy's bulge is a linear parametric `Sersic` bulge [6 parameters]. 
 
 - The galaxy's disk is a linear parametric `Exponential` disk [6 parameters].
 
  - Parameters which shift the the dataset's image (y_offset_0, x_offset_0) relative to one another are included,
    however this model does not yet have free parameters and is customized in a moment.
 
The number of free parameters and therefore the dimensionality of non-linear parameter space is N=17.
"""
bulge = af.Model(ag.lp_linear.Sersic)
disk = af.Model(ag.lp_linear.Exponential)

galaxy = af.Model(ag.Galaxy, redshift=0.5, bulge=bulge, disk=disk)

dataset_model = af.Model(ag.DatasetModel)

model = af.Collection(
    dataset_model=dataset_model, galaxies=af.Collection(galaxy=galaxy)
)

"""
The `DatasetModel` can apply a shift to each dataset, however we do not want this to be applied to both
datasets as they will then both have free parameters for the same offset, duplicating free parameters.

The default prior on a `DatasetModel`'s offsets are actually not a prior, but fixed values of (0.0, 0.0),
meaning that if we do not update the model the shift will not be applied to the datasets.

We therefore update the `DatasetModel` below, to only apply a shift to the second dataset, which is the r-band image.

If we add more datasets, the code will apply the shift to each one after the first dataset, which are all shifted
relative to the first dataset, making it the reference point.

"""
Simulator: Dataset Offsets
==========================

Multi-wavelength datasets often have offsets between their images, which are due to the different telescope pointings
during the observations.

These offsets are often accounted for during the data reduction process, which aligns the images, however:

 - Certain data reduction pipelines may not perfectly align the images, and the scientist may be unsure what the
 true offset between the images are.

 - Even if the reduction process does align the images, there is still a small uncertainty in the offset due to the
   precision of the telescope pointing which for detailed galaxy models must be accounted for.

This script simulate a multi-wavelength `Imaging` dataset where the two images have a small offset between them. This
offset impacts the galaxy calculation and modeling if not accounted for. It is used in the `modeling` examples to show
how to include the offset as a free parameter in the model-fit.

__Model__

This script simulates multi-wavelength `Imaging` of a galaxy where:

 - The galaxy's light is a parametric `Sersic` bulge and `Exponential` disk.

Two images are simulated, corresponding to a greener ('g' band) redder image (`r` band).

This is an advanced script and assumes previous knowledge of the core **PyAutoGalaxy** API for simulating images. Thus,
certain parts of code are not documented to ensure the script is concise.

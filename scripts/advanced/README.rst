The ``imaging/advanced`` folder contains example scripts for analysing imaging datasets (E.g. Hubble Space Telescope).

Folders (Advanced)
------------------

- ``multi``: Examples for multiple datasets simultaneously (E.g. multi-wavelength imaging, imaging and interferometry).
- ``log_likelihood_function``: A step-by-step visual guide to how likelihoods are evaluated in **PyAutoGalaxy**.
- ``chaining``: Examples using non-linear search chaining to fit complex models to imaging data.
- ``graphical``: Examples that fit a graphical model to multiple imaging lens datasets simultaneously.

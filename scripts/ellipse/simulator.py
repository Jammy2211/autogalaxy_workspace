Simulator: Ellipse
==================

Ellipse fitting is a common technique in astronomy to determine the shape of a galaxy, which fits a super
position of multiple elliptical isophotes to an image of a galaxy. This allows the ellipticity and position angle of
a galaxy to be determined.

This script simulates a very elliptical galaxy with a `Sersic` light profile, which is used to illustrate ellipse fitting
in the `autogalaxy_workspace/*/notebooks/modeling/imaging/fearure/ellipse_fitting.py` example.

This script simulates `Imaging` of a galaxy using light profiles where:

 - The galaxy's bulge is an `Sersic`.

__Contents__

**Dataset Paths:** Setting the output path for simulated data.
**Grid:** Creating the 2D grid for evaluating galaxy images with adaptive over-sampling.
**Galaxies:** Setting up the galaxy with an elliptical Sersic bulge.
**Output:** Saving the simulated dataset to FITS files.
**Visualize:** Outputting subplot and image visualizations as PNG files.
**Plane Output:** Saving the galaxy model as a JSON file for future reference.

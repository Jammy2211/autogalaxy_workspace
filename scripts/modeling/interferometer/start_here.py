"""
__Mask__

We define the ‘real_space_mask’ which defines the grid the image the galaxy is evaluated using.
"""
real_space_mask = ag.Mask2D.circular(
    shape_native=(800, 800), pixel_scales=0.05, radius=4.0
)

"""
__Dataset__

Load and plot the galaxy `Interferometer` dataset `simple__sersic` from .fits files, which we will fit 
with the model.

This includes the method used to Fourier transform the real-space image of the galaxy to the uv-plane and compare 
directly to the visiblities. We use a non-uniform fast Fourier transform, which is the most efficient method for 
interferometer datasets containing ~1-10 million visibilities.

"""
__Over Sampling__

If you are familiar with using imaging data, you may have seen that a numerical technique called over sampling is used, 
which evaluates light profiles on a higher resolution grid than the image data to ensure the calculation is accurate.

Interferometer does not observe galaxies in a way where over sampling is necessary, therefore all interferometer
calculations are performed without over sampling.

__Model__

We compose our model using `Model` objects, which represent the galaxies we fit to our data. In this 
example we fit a model where:

 - The galaxy's light is a linear parametric `Sersic` bulge and `Exponential` disk, the centres of 
 which are aligned [10 parameters].
 
The number of free parameters and therefore the dimensionality of non-linear parameter space is N=10.

__Linear Light Profiles__

The model below uses a `linear light profile` for the bulge and disk, via the API `lp_linear`. This is a specific type 
of light profile that solves for the `intensity` of each profile that best fits the data via a linear inversion. 
This means it is not a free parameter, reducing the dimensionality of non-linear parameter space. 

Linear light profiles significantly improve the speed, accuracy and reliability of modeling and they are used
by default in every modeling example. A full description of linear light profiles is provided in the
`autogalaxy_workspace/*/imaging/modeling/features/linear_light_profiles.py` example.

A standard light profile can be used if you change the `lp_linear` to `lp`, but it is not recommended.

__Coordinates__

The model fitting default settings assume that the galaxy centre is near the coordinates (0.0", 0.0"). 

If for your dataset the galaxy is not centred at (0.0", 0.0"), we recommend that you either: 

 - Reduce your data so that the centre is (`autogalaxy_workspace/*/preprocess`). 
 - Manually override the model priors (`autogalaxy_workspace/*/modeling/imaging/customize/priors.py`).
"""
bulge = af.Model(ag.lp_linear.Sersic)
disk = af.Model(ag.lp_linear.Exponential)
bulge.centre = disk.centre

galaxy = af.Model(ag.Galaxy, redshift=0.5, bulge=bulge, disk=disk)

model = af.Collection(galaxies=af.Collection(galaxy=galaxy))

"""
The `info` attribute shows the model in a readable format.

[The `info` below may not display optimally on your computer screen, for example the whitespace between parameter
names on the left and parameter priors on the right may lead them to appear across multiple lines. This is a
common issue in Jupyter notebooks.

The`info_whitespace_length` parameter in the file `config/generag.yaml` in the [output] section can be changed to 
increase or decrease the amount of whitespace (The Jupyter notebook kernel will need to be reset for this change to 
appear in a notebook).]
"""
print(model.info)

"""
__Search__

The model is fitted to the data using a non-linear search. In this example, we use the nested sampling algorithm 
Nautilus (https://nautilus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The folders: 

 - `autogalaxy_workspace/*/imaging/modeling/searches`.
 - `autogalaxy_workspace/*/modeling/imaging/customize`
  
Give overviews of the  non-linear searches **PyAutoGalaxy** supports and more details on how to customize the
model-fit, including the priors on the model. 

The `name` and `path_prefix` below specify the path where results are stored in the output folder:  

 `/autogalaxy_workspace/output/imaging/simple__sersic/mass[sie]/unique_identifier`.

__Unique Identifier__

In the path above, the `unique_identifier` appears as a collection of characters, where this identifier is generated 
based on the model, search and dataset that are used in the fit.
 
An identical combination of model, search and dataset generates the same identifier, meaning that rerunning the
script will use the existing results to resume the model-fit. In contrast, if you change the model, search or dataset,
a new unique identifier will be generated, ensuring that the model-fit results are output into a separate folder.

__Number Of Cores__

We include an input `number_of_cores`, which when above 1 means that Nautilus uses parallel processing to sample multiple 
models at once on your CPU. When `number_of_cores=2` the search will run roughly two times as
fast, for `number_of_cores=3` three times as fast, and so on. The downside is more cores on your CPU will be in-use
which may hurt the general performance of your computer.

You should experiment to figure out the highest value which does not give a noticeable loss in performance of your 
computer. If you know that your processor is a quad-core processor you should be able to use `number_of_cores=4`. 

Above `number_of_cores=4` the speed-up from parallelization diminishes greatly. We therefore recommend you do not
use a value above this.

For users on a Windows Operating system, using `number_of_cores>1` may lead to an error, in which case it should be 
reduced back to 1 to fix it.
"""
search = af.Nautilus(
    path_prefix=path.join("interferometer", "modeling"),
    name="start_here",
    unique_tag=dataset_name,
    n_live=100,
    number_of_cores=1,
)

"""
__Analysis__

The `AnalysisInterferometer` object defines the `log_likelihood_function` used by the non-linear search to fit the 
model to the `Interferometer`dataset.
"""
analysis = ag.AnalysisInterferometer(dataset=dataset)

"""
__Run Times__

modeling can be a computationally expensive process. When fitting complex models to high resolution datasets 
run times can be of order hours, days, weeks or even months.

Run times are dictated by two factors:

 - The log likelihood evaluation time: the time it takes for a single `instance` of the model to be fitted to 
   the dataset such that a log likelihood is returned.

 - The number of iterations (e.g. log likelihood evaluations) performed by the non-linear search: more complex lens
   models require more iterations to converge to a solution.

The log likelihood evaluation time can be estimated before a fit using the `profile_log_likelihood_function` method,
which returns two dictionaries containing the run-times and information about the fit.
"""
run_time_dict, info_dict = analysis.profile_log_likelihood_function(
    instance=model.random_instance()
)

"""
The overall log likelihood evaluation time is given by the `fit_time` key.

For this example, it should be around ~0.25 seconds, which is extremely fast for interferometer modeling. 
More advanced modeling features (e.g. shapelets, multi Gaussian expansions, pixelizations) have slower log 
likelihood evaluation times (1-3 seconds), and you should be wary of this when using these features.PointDataset
"""
print(f"Log Likelihood Evaluation Time (second) = {run_time_dict['fit_time']}")

"""
To estimate the expected overall run time of the model-fit we multiply the log likelihood evaluation time by an 
estimate of the number of iterations the non-linear search will perform. 

Estimating this quantity is more tricky, as it varies depending on the model complexity (e.g. number of parameters)
and the properties of the dataset and model being fitted.

For this example, we conservatively estimate that the non-linear search will perform ~10000 iterations per free 
parameter in the model. This is an upper limit, with models typically converging in far fewer iterations.

If you perform the fit over multiple CPUs, you can divide the run time by the number of cores to get an estimate of
the time it will take to fit the model. Parallelization with Nautilus scales well, it speeds up the model-fit by the 
`number_of_cores` for N < 8 CPUs and roughly `0.5*number_of_cores` for N > 8 CPUs. This scaling continues 
for N> 50 CPUs, meaning that with super computing facilities you can always achieve fast run times!
"""
print(
    "Estimated Run Time Upper Limit (seconds) = ",
    (run_time_dict["fit_time"] * model.total_free_parameters * 10000)
    / search.number_of_cores,
)

"""
__Model-Fit__

We can now begin the model-fit by passing the model and analysis object to the search, which performs a non-linear
search to find which models fit the data with the highest likelihood.

Checkout the output folder for live outputs of the results of the fit, including on-the-fly visualization of the best 
fit model!
"""
result = search.fit(model=model, analysis=analysis)

"""
__Output Folder__

Now this is running you should checkout the `autogalaxy_workspace/output` folder. This is where the results of the 
search are written to hard-disk (in the `start_here` folder), where all outputs are human readable (e.g. as .json,
.csv or text files).

As the fit progresses, results are written to the `output` folder on the fly using the highest likelihood model found
by the non-linear search so far. This means you can inspect the results of the model-fit as it runs, without having to
wait for the non-linear search to terminate.
 
The `output` folder includes:

 - `model.info`: Summarizes the model, its parameters and their priors discussed in the next tutorial.
 
 - `model.results`: Summarizes the highest likelihood model inferred so far including errors.
 
 - `images`: Visualization of the highest likelihood model-fit to the dataset, (e.g. a fit subplot showing the 
 galaxies, model data and residuals).
 
 - `files`: A folder containing .fits files of the dataset, the model as a human-readable .json file, 
 a `.csv` table of every non-linear search sample and other files containing information about the model-fit.
 
 - search.summary: A file providing summary statistics on the performance of the non-linear search.
 
 - `search_internal`: Internal files of the non-linear search (in this case Nautilus) used for resuming the fit and
  visualizing the search.

__Result__

The search returns a result object, which whose `info` attribute shows the result in a readable format.

[Above, we discussed that the `info_whitespace_length` parameter in the config files could b changed to make 
the `model.info` attribute display optimally on your computer. This attribute also controls the whitespace of the
`result.info` attribute.]
"""
print(result.info)

"""
The `Result` object also contains:

 - The model corresponding to the maximum log likelihood solution in parameter space.
 - The corresponding maximum log likelihood `Galaxies` and `FitImaging` objects.

"""
The result contains the full posterior information of our non-linear search, including all parameter samples, 
log likelihood values and tools to compute the errors on the lens model. 

There are built in visualization tools for plotting this.

The plot is labeled with short hand parameter names (e.g. `sersic_index` is mapped to the short hand 
parameter `n`). These mappings ate specified in the `config/notation.yaml` file and can be customized by users.

The superscripts of labels correspond to the name each component was given in the model (e.g. for the `Isothermal`
mass its name `mass` defined when making the `Model` above is used).

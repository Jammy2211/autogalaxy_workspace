__Log Likelihood Function: Multi Gaussian Expansion (Interferometer)__

This script provides a step-by-step guide of the `log_likelihood_function` which is used to fit
`Interferometer` data with a multi-Gaussian expansion (MGE): a `Basis` of many linear `Gaussian` profiles
whose `intensity` values are solved for analytically via a linear inversion.

The visibility-plane linear inversion is **mathematically identical** to the single-component linear light
profile case (see `interferometer/features/linear_light_profiles/likelihood_function.py`). The only
difference is the number of columns in the mapping matrix — one column per Gaussian in the basis instead
of one column total. The data vector `D` and curvature matrix `F` therefore have dimensions equal to the
basis size, and the solved `s = F^{-1} D` gives one `intensity` per Gaussian.

For interferometer data this is now practical thanks to the JAX-native NUFFT `nufftax`
(https://github.com/GragasLab/nufftax) — every Gaussian's NUFFT happens inside the same jit/vmap pipeline
as the rest of the model, so the per-iteration NUFFT cost scales linearly with the basis size and is
amortised on the GPU.

__Prerequisites__

The MGE likelihood function builds on:

 - `interferometer/log_likelihood_function.ipynb` — the standard interferometer parametric likelihood
   function (NUFFT of a real-space image, visibility-plane $\\chi^2$).
 - `interferometer/features/linear_light_profiles/likelihood_function.ipynb` — the single-component
   visibility-plane linear inversion (data vector, curvature matrix, positive-only solver). The MGE is a
   direct generalisation to N-component bases.

This script repeats just enough setup that you can follow it without rereading those two — but if anything
is unclear, those are the places to look first.

For an N-Gaussian MGE this matrix has N columns. The inversion's job is to find the N scalars that, when
multiplied by their respective columns and summed, best fit the observed visibilities.

Warren & Dye 2003 (https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0302587) (hereafter WD03) introduce the linear inversion
formalism used to compute the intensity values of the linear light profiles. WD03 indexes the transformed
mapping matrix as $f_{ij}$ where $i$ maps over all $I$ linear basis components and $j$ maps over all $J$
visibilities. For our MGE, $I = $ `total_gaussians`.

__Data Vector (D)__

To solve for the per-Gaussian intensities we pose the problem as a linear inversion.

The `data_vector`, $D$, has dimensions `(total_gaussians,)`. In WD03 the data vector is given by:

 $\\vec{D}_{i} = \\sum_{\\rm  j=1}^{J} f_{ij}\\, d_{j} / \\sigma_{j}^2 \\, ,$

where $d_j$ are the observed visibility values, $\\sigma_j^2$ are the visibility variances, and the sum
runs over real and imaginary components. The interferometer helper handles the real/imaginary split
internally.

__Curvature Matrix (F)__

The `curvature_matrix` $F$ has dimensions `(total_gaussians, total_gaussians)`.

In WD03 the curvature matrix is given by:

 ${F}_{ik} = \\sum_{\\rm  j=1}^{J} f_{ij}\\, f_{kj} / \\sigma_{j}^2 \\, .$

Because visibilities (and therefore $f$) are complex-valued, the curvature is computed separately for the
real and imaginary parts and summed.

For an N-Gaussian MGE $F$ is an NxN matrix; the off-diagonal entries $F_{ik}$ quantify how much Gaussians
$i$ and $k$ overlap in the visibility plane. Adjacent Gaussians (similar sigma) have large overlaps; very
different sigmas overlap less.

WD03):

 $s = F^{-1} D$

For an MGE this often returns negative `intensity` values for some Gaussians — the "ringing" pattern
where alternating Gaussians take large positive/negative values. This is unphysical.

__Reconstruction (Positive Only)__

The linear algebra can be solved with the constraint that all `intensity` values are positive. The naive
approach is `scipy.optimize.nnls`, which is iterative and works directly on the transformed mapping matrix
— slow for many Gaussians.

The source code therefore uses a "fast nnls" algorithm — an adaptation of:
  https://github.com/jvendrow/fnnls

`fnnls` uses `data_vector` $D$ and `curvature_matrix` $F$ (not the full mapping matrix), which makes it
much faster than scipy's nnls. This is essential for MGE because the basis size can be large.

__Likelihood Function__

regularisation — its smoothness comes from the basis-function form, not from a regularisation matrix.)

The first term is a $\\chi^2$ statistic computed in the visibility plane. Visibilities are complex-valued,
so we split into real and imaginary components, compute $\\chi^2$ for each, and sum.

__Galaxy Modeling__

To fit a galaxy model to data, the likelihood function illustrated in this tutorial is sampled using a
non-linear search algorithm.

The default sampler is the nested sampling algorithm `nautilus`
(https://github.com/johannesulf/nautilus); multiple MCMC and optimization algorithms are also supported.

For an MGE, the reduced number of free parameters (intensities are solved analytically, sigmas are fixed,
centres and ell_comps are shared) means that the sampler converges in fewer iterations than a
free-intensity Sersic — even though each likelihood evaluation is slower per-iteration because of the
larger basis.

__Wrap Up__

We have presented a visual step-by-step guide to the multi-Gaussian expansion interferometer likelihood
function. The pipeline:

  image → Gaussian images (intensity=1 each) → `mapping_matrix` (N columns)
  → NUFFT → `transformed_mapping_matrix` → $D$ (length N) and $F$ (NxN) → solve $s = F^{-1} D$
  → `mapped_reconstructed_visibilities` → visibility-plane $\\chi^2$ → log likelihood

is the same as for the single-component linear light profile case
(`features/linear_light_profiles/likelihood_function.py`), just generalised to N basis components.

Simulator: Same Wavelength
==========================

This script simulates multiple `Imaging` datasets of a galaxy where:

 - The galaxy's light is a parametric `Sersic` bulge and `Exponential` disk.

Unlike other `multi` simulators, all datasets are at the same wavelength and therefore the source does not change
its appearance in each dataset.

This dataset demonstrates how PyAutoGalaxy's multi-dataset modeling tools can also simultaneously analyse datasets
observed at the same wavelength.

An example use case might be analysing undithered HST images before they are combined via the multidrizzing process,
to remove correlated noise in the data.

TODO: NEED TO INCLUDE DIFFERENT POINTING / CENTERINGS.

__Contents__

**Dataset Paths:** Setting the output path for simulated data.
**Simulate:** Creating grids with matching pixel scales for same-wavelength observations.
**Galaxies:** Setting up the galaxy with bulge and disk light profiles at one wavelength.
**Output:** Saving the simulated datasets to FITS files.
**Visualize:** Outputting subplot and image visualizations as PNG files.
**Galaxies json:** Saving the galaxy model as a JSON file for future reference.

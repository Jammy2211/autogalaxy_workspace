The ``multi/advanced`` folder contains example scripts for analysing multiple datasets simultaneously (E.g. multi-wavelength
Hubble Space Telescope imaging).

Fitting multiple datasets is an advanced **PyAutoGalaxy** feature and we recommend users have experience fitting
individual datasets via the ``imaging`` package first.

Folders (Advanced)

- ``chaining``: Using non-linear search chaining to fit complex galaxy models to multiple imaging datasets.
- ``graphical``: Fitting graphical models to multiple imaging galaxy datasets simultaneously.

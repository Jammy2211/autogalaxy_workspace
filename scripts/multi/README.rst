The ``multi`` folder contains example scripts for analysing multiple datasets simultaneously (E.g. multi-wavelength
Hubble Space Telescope imaging).

Fitting multiple datasets is an advanced **PyAutoGalaxy** feature and we recommend users have experience fitting
individual datasets via the ``imaging`` package first.

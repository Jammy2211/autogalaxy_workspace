The ``pixelization`` folder contains example scripts showing how to perform analysis using a pixelized source reconstruction.

Files
-----

The following example scripts illustrating lens modeling where:

- ``modeling``: Lens modeling using a pixelized source reconstruction.
- ``fit``: Fit a pixelized source and compute quantities like the residuals, chi squared and likelihood.
- ``likelihood_function``: A step-by-step guide of the pixelized source likelihood function.
- ``source_reconstruction``: How to output a source reconstruction from a pixelized source model fit. to a .csv which can be loaded to analyse the source without autogalaxy.

Results

These scripts only give a brief overview of how to analyse and interpret the results a lens model fit.

A full guide to result analysis is given at ``autolens_workspace/*/guides/results``.

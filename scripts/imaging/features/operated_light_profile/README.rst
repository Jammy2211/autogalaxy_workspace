The ``operated_light_profile`` folder contains example scripts showing how to perform analysis using operated light
profiles, which represent the light of galaxies after PSF convolution.

The following example scripts illustrating galaxy modeling where:

- ``modeling``: Galaxy modeling using operated light profiles.
- ``simulator``: Simulating a galaxy using operated light profiles.

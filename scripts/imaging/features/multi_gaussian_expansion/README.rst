The ``multi_gaussian_expansion`` folder contains example scripts showing how to perform analysis using a Multi Gaussian Expansion (MGE).

Files
-----

The following example scripts illustrating galaxy modeling where:

- ``modeling``: Modeling using an MGE.
- ``simulator``: Simulating galaxy data with complexity in its light which requires an MGE to capture accurately.
- ``fit``: Fit an MGE and compute quantities like the residuals, chi squared and likelihood.
- ``likelihood_function``: A step-by-step guide of the MGE likelihood function.

Results
-------

These scripts only give a brief overview of how to analyse and interpret the results a model fit.

A full guide to result analysis is given at ``autogalaxy_workspace/*/results``.

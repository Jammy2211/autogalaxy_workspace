The ``extra_galaxies`` folder contains example scripts showing how to perform analysis using the extra galaxies
API, which includes extra galaxies surrounding a galaxy in the galaxy model, modeling their light and / or mass.

Files

The following example scripts illustrating galaxy modeling where:

- ``modeling``: galaxy modeling using a model which includes extra galaxies.
- ``simulator``: Simulating galaxy data with extra galaxies surrounding it.
- ``chaining``: Using non-linear search chaining to perform modeling where extra galaxies are fitted one-by-one initially.

These scripts only give a brief overview of how to analyse and interpret the results a galaxy model fit.

A full guide to result analysis is given at ``autogalaxy_workspace/*/results``.

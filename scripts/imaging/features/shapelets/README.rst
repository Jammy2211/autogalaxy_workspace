The ``shapelets`` folder contains example scripts showing how to perform analysis using shapelets, which are a set
of basis functions which represent certain types of galaxy morphologies (e.g. disks) accurately.

Files
-----

The following example scripts illustrating galaxy modeling where:

- ``modeling``: Galaxy modeling using shapelets.
- ``fit``: Fit shapelets and compute quantities like the residuals, chi squared and likelihood.

Results
-------

These scripts only give a brief overview of how to analyse and interpret the results a galaxy model fit.

A full guide to result analysis is given at ``autogalaxy_workspace/*/results``.

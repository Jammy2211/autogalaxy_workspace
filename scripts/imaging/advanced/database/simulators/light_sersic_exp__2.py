Simulator: Sersic + Exp
=======================

This script simulates `Imaging` of a galaxy using light profiles where:

 - The galaxy's bulge is an `Sersic`.
 - The galaxy's disk is an `Exponential`.

__Dataset Paths__

The `dataset_type` describes the type of data being simulated (in this case, `Imaging` data) and `dataset_name`
gives it a descriptive name. They define the folder the dataset is output to on your hard-disk:

 - The image will be output to `/autogalaxy_workspace/dataset/dataset_type/dataset_name/image.fits`.
 - The noise-map will be output to `/autogalaxy_workspace/dataset/dataset_type/dataset_name/noise_map.fits`.
 - The psf will be output to `/autogalaxy_workspace/dataset/dataset_type/dataset_name/psf.fits`.
"""
dataset_type = "database"
dataset_name = "simple__2"

"""
The path where the dataset will be output, which in this case is:
`/autogalaxy_workspace/dataset/database/simple__2`
"""
dataset_path = path.join("dataset", dataset_type, dataset_name)

"""
__Simulate__

When simulating the amount of emission in each image pixel from galaxies, a two dimensional line integral of all of 
the emission within the area of that pixel should be performed. However, for complex models this can be difficult 
to analytically compute and can lead to slow run times.

Instead, an iterative algorithm is used to approximate the line integral. Grids of increasing resolution are used to 
evaluate the flux in each pixel from the lens and source galaxies. Grids of higher resolution are used until the 
fractional accuracy of the flux in each pixel meets a certain threshold, which we set below to 99.99%

This uses the `OverSamplingIterate` object, which is input into to the `Grid2D` object you may have seen in other 
example scripts, however it make sit perform the iterative ray-tracing described above.

This ensures that the divergent and bright central regions of the galaxy are fully resolved when determining the
total flux emitted within a pixel.
"""
grid = ag.Grid2D.uniform(
    shape_native=(100, 100),
    pixel_scales=0.1,
    over_sampling=ag.OverSamplingIterate(
        fractional_accuracy=0.9999, sub_steps=[2, 4, 8, 16]
    ),
)

Simulate a simple Gaussian PSF for the image.
"""
psf = ag.Kernel2D.from_gaussian(
    shape_native=(11, 11), sigma=0.1, pixel_scales=grid.pixel_scales
)

"""
To simulate the `Imaging` dataset we first create a simulator, which defines the exposure time, background sky,
noise levels and psf of the dataset that is simulated.
"""
simulator = ag.SimulatorImaging(
    exposure_time=300.0, psf=psf, background_sky_level=0.1, add_poisson_noise=True
)

"""
__Galaxies__

Setup the galaxy with a bulge (elliptical Sersic) and disk (elliptical exponential) for this simulation.

For modeling, defining ellipticity in terms of the `ell_comps` improves the model-fitting procedure.

However, for simulating a galaxy you may find it more intuitive to define the elliptical geometry using the 
axis-ratio of the profile (axis_ratio = semi-major axis / semi-minor axis = b/a) and position angle, where angle is
in degrees and defined counter clockwise from the positive x-axis.

We can use the **PyAutoGalaxy** `convert` module to determine the elliptical components from the axis-ratio and angle.
"""

    redshift=0.5,
    bulge=ag.lp.Sersic(
        centre=(0.0, 0.0),

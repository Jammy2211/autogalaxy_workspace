Simulator: Sersic + Exp
=======================

This script simulates `Imaging` of a galaxy using light profiles where:

 - The galaxy's bulge is an `Sersic`.
 - The galaxy's disk is an `Exponential`.

__Dataset Paths__

The `dataset_type` describes the type of data being simulated (in this case, `Imaging` data) and `dataset_name`
gives it a descriptive name. They define the folder the dataset is output to on your hard-disk:

 - The image will be output to `/autogalaxy_workspace/dataset/dataset_type/dataset_name/image.fits`.
 - The noise-map will be output to `/autogalaxy_workspace/dataset/dataset_type/dataset_name/noise_map.fits`.
 - The psf will be output to `/autogalaxy_workspace/dataset/dataset_type/dataset_name/psf.fits`.
"""
dataset_type = "imaging"
dataset_name = "simple"

"""
The path where the dataset will be output, which in this case is:
`/autogalaxy_workspace/dataset/imaging/simple`
"""
dataset_path = path.join("dataset", dataset_type, dataset_name)

"""
__Grid__

Define the 2d grid of (y,x) coordinates that the galaxy images are evaluated and therefore simulated on, via
the inputs:

 - `shape_native`: The (y_pixels, x_pixels) 2D shape of the grid defining the shape of the data that is simulated.
 - `pixel_scales`: The arc-second to pixel conversion factor of the grid and data.

__Over Sampling__

Over sampling is a numerical technique where the images of light profiles and galaxies are evaluated 
on a higher resolution grid than the image data to ensure the calculation is accurate. 

An iterative algorithm is used to perform this efficiently by inputting the `OverSamplingIterate` object. Grids of 
increasing resolution are used to evaluate the flux in each pixel from the galaxies, until the fractional accuracy of 
the flux in each pixel meets a certain threshold, which we set below to 99.99%

Iterative over sampling is relatively slow, but it provides a more accurate result. Slow run times are ok for 
simulating data, but for tasks which require more rapid run times (e.g. model-fitting) an adaptive over sampling 
algorithm is used, which provides high levels of over sampling only where it is necessary making the process much faster.

Once you are more experienced, you should read up on over-sampling in more detail via 
the `autogalaxy_workspace/*/guides/over_sampling.ipynb` notebook.

grid = ag.Grid2D.uniform(
    shape_native=(100, 100),
    pixel_scales=0.1,
    over_sampling=ag.OverSamplingIterate(
        fractional_accuracy=0.9999, sub_steps=[2, 4, 8, 16]
    ),

"""
psf = ag.Kernel2D.from_gaussian(
    shape_native=(11, 11), sigma=0.1, pixel_scales=grid.pixel_scales
)

"""
To simulate the `Imaging` dataset we first create a simulator, which defines the exposure time, background sky,
noise levels and psf of the dataset that is simulated.
"""
simulator = ag.SimulatorImaging(
    exposure_time=300.0, psf=psf, background_sky_level=0.1, add_poisson_noise=True
)

"""
__Galaxies__

Setup the galaxy with a bulge (elliptical Sersic) and disk (elliptical exponential) for this simulation.

For modeling, defining ellipticity in terms of the `ell_comps` improves the model-fitting procedure.

However, for simulating a galaxy you may find it more intuitive to define the elliptical geometry using the 
axis-ratio of the profile (axis_ratio = semi-major axis / semi-minor axis = b/a) and position angle, where angle is
in degrees and defined counter clockwise from the positive x-axis.

We can use the **PyAutoGalaxy** `convert` module to determine the elliptical components from the axis-ratio and angle.

    redshift=0.5,

        centre=(0.0, 0.0),

__Plane Output__

Save the `Galaxies` in the dataset folder as a .json file, ensuring the true light profiles and galaxies

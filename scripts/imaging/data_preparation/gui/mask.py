GUI Preprocessing: Mask
=======================

This tool allows one to mask a bespoke mask for a given image of a galaxy using an interactive GUI. This mask
can then be loaded before a pipeline is run and passed to that pipeline so as to become the default masked used by a
search (if a mask function is not passed to that search).

This GUI is adapted from the following code: https://gist.github.com/brikeats/4f63f867fd8ea0f196c78e9b835150ab

__Contents__

**Dataset:** Loading the imaging dataset for mask creation.
**Scribbler:** Using the interactive GUI to draw the mask.
**Output:** Saving the mask as a FITS file and PNG visualization.

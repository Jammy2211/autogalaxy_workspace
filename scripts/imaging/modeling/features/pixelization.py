"""
Modeling: Light Inversion
=========================

This script fits an `Imaging` dataset of a galaxy with a model where:

 - The galaxy's light is modeled using an `Inversion` with a rectangular pixelization and constant regularization
 scheme.

An `Inversion` reconstructs the source's light using a pixel-grid, which is regularized using a prior that forces
this reconstruction to be smooth. Due to the simplicity of this example the inversion effectively just find a model
galaxy image that is denoised and deconvolved.

More complicated and useful inversion fits are given elsewhere in the workspace (e.g. the `chaining` package), where
they are combined with light profiles to fit irregular galaxies in a efficient way.

Inversions are covered in detail in chapter 4 of the **HowToGalaxy** lectures.

__Positive Only Solver__

All pixelized source reconstructions use a positive-only solver, meaning that every source-pixel is only allowed
to reconstruct positive flux values. This ensures that the source reconstruction is physical and that we don't
reconstruct negative flux values that don't exist in the real source galaxy (a common systematic solution in lens
analysis).

It may be surprising to hear that this is a feature worth pointing out, but it turns out setting up the linear algebra
to enforce positive reconstructions is difficult to make efficient. A lot of development time went into making this
possible, where a bespoke fast non-negative linear solver was developed to achieve this.

Other methods in the literature often do not use a positive only solver, and therefore suffer from these
unphysical solutions, which can degrade the results of lens model in general.

__Dataset__

Load and plot the galaxy dataset `complex` via .fits files, where:
 
  -The galaxy's bulge is an `Sersic`.
 - The galaxy's disk is an `Exponential`.
 - The galaxy's has four star forming clumps which are `Sersic` profiles.
"""
dataset_name = "simple__sersic"
dataset_path = path.join("dataset", "imaging", dataset_name)

dataset = ag.Imaging.from_fits(
    data_path=path.join(dataset_path, "data.fits"),

    pixel_scales=0.1,
)

dataset_plotter = aplt.ImagingPlotter(dataset=dataset)

"""
__Mask__

Define a 3.0" circular mask, which includes the emission of the galaxy.
"""
mask = ag.Mask2D.circular(
    shape_native=dataset.shape_native, pixel_scales=dataset.pixel_scales, radius=2.0
)

dataset = dataset.apply_mask(mask=mask)

dataset_plotter = aplt.ImagingPlotter(dataset=dataset)

"""
__Model__

We compose our model using `Model` objects, which represent the galaxies we fit to our data.  In this 
example we fit a model where:

 - The galaxy's light uses a `Rectangular` meshwhose resolution is free to vary (2 parameters). 
 - This pixelization is regularized using a `Constant` scheme which smooths every source pixel equally [1 parameter]. 

The number of free parameters and therefore the dimensionality of non-linear parameter space is N=3. 
 
It is worth noting the `Pixelization`  use significantly fewer parameters (3 parameters) than 
fitting this complex galaxy using parametric light profiles would (20+ parameters). 
"""
pixelization = af.Model(
    ag.Pixelization, mesh=ag.mesh.Rectangular, regularization=ag.reg.Constant
)

galaxy = af.Model(ag.Galaxy, redshift=0.5, pixelization=pixelization)

model = af.Collection(galaxies=af.Collection(galaxy=galaxy))

"""
The `info` attribute shows the model in a readable format.
"""
print(model.info)

"""
__Search__

The model is fitted to the data using a non-linear search. In this example, we use the nested sampling algorithm 
Nautilus (https://nautilus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

A full description of the settings below is given in the beginner modeling scripts, if anything is unclear.
"""
search = af.Nautilus(
    path_prefix=path.join("imaging", "modeling"),
    name="light[pixelization]",
    unique_tag=dataset_name,
    n_live=100,
    number_of_cores=1,
)

"""
__Analysis__

Create the `AnalysisImaging` object defining how the model is fitted to the data. 
"""
analysis = ag.AnalysisImaging(dataset=dataset)

"""
__Model-Fit__

We begin the model-fit by passing the model and analysis object to the non-linear search (checkout the output folder
for on-the-fly visualization and results).
"""
result = search.fit(model=model, analysis=analysis)

"""
__Result__

The search returns a result object, which whose `info` attribute shows the result in a readable format:
"""
print(result.info)

"""
We plot the maximum likelihood fit, galaxy images and posteriors inferred via Nautilus.

The galaxy bulge and disk appear similar to those in the data, confirming that the `intensity` values inferred by
the inversion process are accurate.
"""
print(result.max_log_likelihood_instance)

galaxies_plotter = aplt.GalaxiesPlotter(
    galaxies=result.max_log_likelihood_galaxies, grid=result.grids.uniform
)

"""
__Result (Advanced)__

The code belows shows all additional results that can be computed from a `Result` object following a fit with a
pixelization.

__Max Likelihood Inversion__

As seen elsewhere in the workspace, the result contains a `max_log_likelihood_fit`, which contains the
`Inversion` object we need.
"""
inversion = result.max_log_likelihood_fit.inversion

"""
This `Inversion` can be used to plot the reconstructed image of specifically all linear light profiles and the
reconstruction of the `Pixelization`.
"""
inversion_plotter = aplt.InversionPlotter(inversion=inversion)
inversion_plotter.figures_2d(reconstructed_image=True)
inversion_plotter.figures_2d_of_pixelization(pixelization_index=0, reconstruction=True)

"""
__Linear Objects__

An `Inversion` contains all of the linear objects used to reconstruct the data in its `linear_obj_list`. 

This list may include the following objects:

 - `LightProfileLinearObjFuncList`: This object contains lists of linear light profiles and the functionality used
 by them to reconstruct data in an inversion. For example it may only contain a list with a single light profile
 (e.g. `lp_linear.Sersic`) or many light profiles combined in a `Basis` (e.g. `lp_basis.Basis`).
 
- `Mapper`: The linear objected used by a `Pixelization` to reconstruct data via an `Inversion`, where the `Mapper` 
is specific to the `Pixelization`'s `Mesh` (e.g. a `RectnagularMapper` is used for a `Rectangular` mesh).

In this example, the only linear object used to fit the data was a `Pixelization`, thus the `linear_obj_list`
contains just one entry corresponding to a `Mapper`:
"""
print(inversion.linear_obj_list)

"""
To extract results from an inversion many quantities will come in lists or require that we specific the linear object
we with to use. 

Thus, knowing what linear objects are contained in the `linear_obj_list` and what indexes they correspond to
is important.
"""
print(f"Rectangular Mapper = {inversion.linear_obj_list[0]}")

"""
__Interpolated Galaxy__

The pixelized reconstruction used by an `Inversion` may be a different resolution to the data, making it difficult to 
manipulate and inspect after the modeling has completed.

A simpler way to inspect the reconstruction is to interpolate the reconstruction values from rectangular grid
resolution to a uniform 2D grid of pixels.

(if you do not know what the `slim` and `native` properties below refer too, check back to tutorial 2 of the results
for a description).

Inversions can have multiple reconstructions (e.g. if separate pixelizations are used for each galaxy) thus the 
majority of quantities are returned as a list. It is likely you are only using one `Inversion` to one galaxy,
so these lists will likely contain only one entry

We interpolate the pixelization this galaxy is reconstructed on to a 2D grid of 401 x 401 square pixels. 
"""
interpolated_reconstruction_list = inversion.interpolated_reconstruction_list_from(
    shape_native=(401, 401)
)

"""
If you are unclear on what `slim` means, refer to the section `Data Structure` at the top of this example.
"""
print(interpolated_reconstruction_list[0].slim)

"""
We can alternatively input the arc-second `extent` of the reconstruction we want, which will not use square 
pixels unless symmetric y and x arc-second extents are input.

The extent is input via the notation (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax), therefore unlike most of the **PyAutoGalaxy** API it
does not follow the (y,x) convention. This will be updated in a future version.
"""
interpolated_reconstruction_list = inversion.interpolated_reconstruction_list_from(
    shape_native=(401, 401), extent=(-1.0, 1.0, -1.0, 1.0)
)

print(interpolated_reconstruction_list[0].slim)

"""
The interpolated errors on the reconstruction can also be computed, in case you are planning to perform 
model-fitting of the source reconstruction.
"""
interpolated_errors_list = inversion.interpolated_errors_list_from(
    shape_native=(401, 401), extent=(-1.0, 1.0, -1.0, 1.0)
)

print(interpolated_errors_list[0].slim)

"""
__Reconstruction__

The reconstruction is also available as a 1D numpy array of values representative of the pixelization
itself (in this example, the reconstructed source values at each rectangular pixel).
"""
print(inversion.reconstruction)

"""
The (y,x) grid of coordinates associated with these values is given by the `Inversion`'s `Mapper` (which are 
described in chapter 4 of **HowToGalaxy**).

Note above how we showed that the first entry of the `linear_obj_list` contains the inversion's `Mapper`.
"""
mapper = inversion.linear_obj_list[0]
print(mapper.source_plane_mesh_grid)

"""
The mapper also contains the (y,x) grid of coordinates that correspond to the imaging data's grid
"""
print(mapper.source_plane_data_grid)

"""
__Mapped Reconstructed Images__

The reconstruction(s) are mapped to the image grid in order to fit the model.

These mapped reconstructed images are also accessible via the `Inversion`. 

Note that any parametric light profiles in the model (e.g. the `bulge` and `disk` of a galaxy) are not 
included in this image -- it only contains the source.
"""
print(inversion.mapped_reconstructed_image.native)

"""
__Linear Algebra Matrices (Advanced)__

To perform an `Inversion` a number of matrices are constructed which use linear algebra to perform the reconstruction.

These are accessible in the inversion object.
"""
print(inversion.curvature_matrix)
print(inversion.regularization_matrix)
print(inversion.curvature_reg_matrix)

"""
__Evidence Terms (Advanced)__

In **HowToGalaxy** and the papers below, we cover how an `Inversion` uses a Bayesian evidence to quantify the goodness
of fit:

https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07377
https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0601493

This evidence balances solutions which fit the data accurately, without using an overly complex regularization source.

The individual terms of the evidence and accessed via the following properties:
"""
print(inversion.regularization_term)
print(inversion.log_det_regularization_matrix_term)
print(inversion.log_det_curvature_reg_matrix_term)

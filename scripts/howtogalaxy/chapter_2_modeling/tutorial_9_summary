Congratulations, you've completed the second chapter of the **PyAutoGalaxy** tutorials!

In this chapter, you learnt:

1) What a non-linear search is.
2) How to use a non-linear search to sample the parameter space of a model.
3) How the priors we give parameters specify our search of this parameter space.
4) How one must carefully balance complexity and realism when fitting a model to a data-set.
5) The importance of factoring in run-speed when modeling a galaxy, and tricks to speed up the analysis.
6) About masking data in the analysis.

At this point, you are ready to begin modeling galaxies. The 'modeling' folders in the
autogalaxy_workspace contains a number of scripts that can be easily adopted to model galaxies using a variety of
different approaches, models and non-linear searches. If you have your own galaxy data, I'd recommend you adapt these
scripts to your data. If you don't have your own data, checkout the 'simulators' folder to simulate your own dataset!

Alternatively, you may wish to continue on to chapter 3 on search chaining.

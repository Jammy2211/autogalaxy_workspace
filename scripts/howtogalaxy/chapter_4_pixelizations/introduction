So, we've learnt how to build pipelines that model galaxies and customize them to our science case.

We consider how using search chaining, we can fix complex galaxies made of multiple components or multiple
galaxies at the same time.

However, we saw a pretty huge barrier when trying to fit very complex galaxies, that it requires an unwieldy number
of non-linear parameters. The non-linear parameter space would become very complex, and even a well crafted pipeline
may not fix the problem.

In this chapter, we'll learn about pixelizations and inversions. These tools allow us to reconstruct components of a
galaxy using a pixel-grid. This makes no assumption about the galaxy's morphology, breaking the simplifying assumptions
inherent to analytic light profiles (e.g. symmetry).

Remarkably, pixels grids use just a couple of non-linear parameters, meaning the 30+ non-linear parameters we required
to fit complex galaxy components before are going to be reduced to just 3 or 4!

By combining these fits with parametric model, we are therefore able to fit certain structures (e.g. a bulge and disk)
whilst using these non-parametric pixelizations to fit other components that may otherwise degrade the fit.

In particular, you'll learn how we:

1) Pixelize a galaxy into a set of pixels that define mappings to image pixels.
2) Invert this pixelization to fit the galaxy and thus reconstruct its light.
3) Apply a smoothness prior on the galaxy reconstruction, called 'regularization', to ensure the solution is physicag.
4) Apply this prior in a Bayesian framework to objectively quantify the galaxy reconstruction's log likelihood.
6) Use alternative pixelizations that use Voronoi pixels adapted to the galaxy's mass model.
7) Use these features in PyAutoGalaxy pipelines.

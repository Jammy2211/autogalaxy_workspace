You are now familiar and have a clear understanding of modeling. In this chapter, we'll
introduce search chaining, a concept we mentioned in the previous chapter. Search chaining allows us to generically link
searches together, so that we can seamlessly navigate the complex non-linear parameter spaces that come when fitting
realistic models.

With these pipelines, you'll be able to:

1) Fit a lens mass model  light model to an image of a strongly lensed source.
2) Additionally fit the galaxy's light, if it is present.
3) Write customized pipelines for galaxy systems with multiple lens galaxies or source galaxies.
4) Customize pipelines such that the priors on parameters during the fit are adjusted to provide a more robust or
   efficient fit.

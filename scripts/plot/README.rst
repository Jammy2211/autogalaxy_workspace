The ``plot` folder contains scripts which show how to use **PyAutoGalaxy** built-in visualization tools.

The **PyAutoGalaxy** API provides a simple interface with matplotlib for making plots that does not require the user to
write any matplotlib code themselves.

This is illustrate in the ``overview.py`` / ``overview.ipynb`` file, which I strongly recommend new users read!

Files (Beginner)
----------------

- ``overview.py``: An overview of plotting and visualization (RECOMMENDED READ).

Folders (Beginner)
------------------

- ``mat_wrap``: Objects which wrap Matplotlib functions which customize a figure's appearance.
- ``multi``: Plotting multiple subplots or lines on 1D figures.
- ``plots``: Output plots written to hard-disk.
- ``plotters``: Plotters which plot specific **PyAutoGalaxy** objects (e.g. ``GalaxyPlotter``, ``PlanePlotter``).
- ``search``: Visualization tools for the results of a non-linear search (e.g. ``DynestyPlotter``).
- ``visuals_1d``: Include 1D visuals on a 1D plot (e.g. a vertical line of the Einstein on a 1D convergence plot).
- ``visuals_2d``: Include 2D visuals on a 2D plot (e.g. a critical curve on an image).

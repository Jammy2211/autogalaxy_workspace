Welcome to the **PyAutoGalaxy** Workspace!

Getting Started
---------------

You can get set up on your personal computer by following the installation guide on
our `readthedocs <https://pyautogalaxy.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Alternatively, you can try **PyAutoGalaxy** out in a web browser by going to
the `autogalaxy workspace on Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/github/PyAutoLabs/autogalaxy_workspace/blob/2026.4.13.6/start_here.ipynb>`_.

New Users
---------

New users should read the ``autogalaxy_workspace/start_here.ipynb`` notebook, which will give you a concise
overview of **PyAutoGalaxy**’s core features and API.

This can be done via a web browser by going to the following Google Colab link:

https://colab.research.google.com/github/PyAutoLabs/autogalaxy_workspace/blob/2026.4.13.6/start_here.ipynb

Then checkout the `new user starting guide <https://pyautogalaxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/overview_2_new_user_guide.html>`_
to navigate the workspace for your science case.

HowToGalaxy
-----------

If you are new to galaxy modeling or the statistical techniques it relies on, the **HowToGalaxy** lecture series
takes you from first principles through to modeling real galaxy imaging data. It now lives in its own repository:

https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/HowToGalaxy

Workspace Structure
-------------------

The workspace includes the following main directories:

- ``notebooks``: **PyAutoGalaxy** examples written as Jupyter notebooks.
- ``scripts``: **PyAutoGalaxy** examples written as Python scripts.
- ``config``: Configuration files which customize **PyAutoGalaxy**’s behaviour.
- ``dataset``: Where data is stored, including example datasets.
- ``output``: Where **PyAutoGalaxy** analysis and visualization outputs are written.

The examples in the ``notebooks`` and ``scripts`` folders are structured as follows:

- ``guides``: Guides which introduce the core features of **PyAutoGalaxy**, including the core galaxy modeling API.
- ``imaging``: Examples for galaxy modeling using CCD imaging (e.g. Hubble, James Webb, Euclid).
- ``interferometer``: Examples for galaxies observed with an interferometer (e.g. ALMA, JVLA).
- ``multi``: Examples for modeling galaxies observed in multiple wavebands.

The dataset packages (e.g. ``imaging``, ``interferometer`` and ``multi``) include the following types of examples:

- ``modeling``: Performing galaxy modeling using that type of data.
- ``simulators``: Simulating galaxy images.
- ``fit``: How to compute residuals, chi-squared maps, and likelihoods.
- ``data_preparation``: Preparing real datasets for **PyAutoGalaxy** analysis.
- ``features``: Advanced modeling features (e.g. Multi Gaussian Expansion, priors, constraints).
- ``likelihood_function``: Step-by-step guides to the likelihood function.

The ``guides`` package contains important subpackages, including:

- ``results``: How to load, inspect, and analyze results from many galaxy fits efficiently.
- ``modeling``: Customizing galaxy models and building automated modeling pipelines.
- ``plot``: How to visualize galaxy images, profiles, and residuals.

The files ``README.rst`` distributed throughout the workspace describe what is in each folder.

Community & Support
-------------------

Support for **PyAutoGalaxy** is available via our Slack workspace, where the community shares updates, discusses
galaxy modeling and analysis, and helps troubleshoot problems.

Slack is invitation-only. If you’d like to join, please send an email requesting an invite.

For installation issues, bug reports, or feature requests, please raise an issue on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoGalaxy/issues).

Contribution
------------

To make changes in the tutorial notebooks, please make changes in the corresponding Python files (``.py``)
present in the ``scripts`` folder of each chapter. The marker ``# %%`` alternates between code cells and
markdown cells.

Build Configuration
-------------------

The ``config/`` directory contains two files used by the automated build and test system
(CI, smoke tests, and pre-release checks). These are not relevant to normal workspace usage.

- ``config/build/no_run.yaml`` — scripts to skip during automated runs. Each entry is a filename stem
  or path pattern with an inline comment explaining why it is skipped.
- ``config/build/env_vars.yaml`` — environment variables applied to each script during automated runs.
  Defines default values (e.g. test mode, small datasets) and per-script overrides for scripts
  that need different settings.

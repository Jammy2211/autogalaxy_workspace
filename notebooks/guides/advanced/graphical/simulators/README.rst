The ``sample`` folder contains example scripts for simulating imaging datasets (E.g. Hubble Space Telescope)
consisting of large samples of galaxies.

This is done by creating a model of the sample's overall population parameters and drawing model parameters
from these prior distributions.

These scripts simulate samples of galaxies consisting of:

- ``dev``: Dev Vaucouleurs light profiles.
- ``dev_exp``: Dev Vaucouleurs + Exponential light profiles.
- ``sersic``: Sersic light profiles
- ``sersic_ser``: Sersic + Sersic light profiles.

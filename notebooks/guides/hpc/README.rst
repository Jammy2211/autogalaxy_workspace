PyAutoGalaxy on High-Performance Computing (HPC)
==============================================

Introduction
------------

This guide describes how to set up and run PyAutoGalaxy on a High-Performance
Computing (HPC) system. It assumes:

- You have access to an HPC cluster via SSH
- The cluster uses the SLURM batch scheduling system
- Python is available via system modules, Conda, or a custom installation

Although every HPC system differs slightly (filesystem layout, module names,
Python versions, storage quotas), the core steps are universal. Where
system-specific details are required, these are clearly marked and easy
to adapt.

Overview of the HPC Workflow
----------------------------

On most HPC systems:

- Home directories have limited storage and are best used for:
  - source code
  - virtual environments
  - configuration files

- Scratch or data filesystems are designed for:
  - large datasets (e.g. ``.fits`` files)
  - PyAutoGalaxy output directories
  - intermediate results

This guide follows best practice by separating:

- the PyAutoGalaxy workspace
- the data and output directories

PyAutoGalaxy Virtual Environment
---------------------------------

Before running PyAutoGalaxy on an HPC system, you should create a Python
virtual environment in your home directory. This environment will contain
PyAutoGalaxy and all its dependencies.

.. note::

   Throughout this guide, replace values written in ALL CAPS (e.g.
   ``YOUR_USERNAME`` or ``HPC_LOGIN_HOST``) with the appropriate values for
   your system.

Installing PyAutoGalaxy: Available Options
----------------------------------------

There are two supported ways to install PyAutoGalaxy on an HPC system.

Option 1 (Recommended): Install via ``pip`` or ``conda``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Simple and robust
- Ideal if you do not need to modify PyAutoGalaxy source code

Option 2: Clone the GitHub repositories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Useful if you are developing PyAutoGalaxy itself
- Follow the instructions in ``README_Repos.rst`` instead of this guide

This document assumes **Option 1**.

Step-by-Step Guide (Installation via ``pip``)
---------------------------------------------

1. SSH into the HPC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From your local machine:

::

   ssh -X YOUR_USERNAME@HPC_LOGIN_HOST

You should now be logged into your home directory on the HPC system.

2. (Optional) Confirm Your Location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   pwd

This should point to something like:

::

   /home/YOUR_USERNAME

3. Create a Python Virtual Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   python3 -m venv PyAuto

This creates a virtual environment called ``PyAuto`` in your home directory.

.. note::

   You may rename this directory if you wish, but you must update paths
   consistently later in this guide.

4. Create an Activation Script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a helper script that loads required modules (if applicable),
activates the virtual environment, and sets environment variables.

::

   nano activate.sh

(Use ``emacs -nw activate.sh`` or ``vi activate.sh`` if you prefer.)

5. Edit ``activate.sh``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Paste the following template and adapt it to your system:

::

   #!/bin/bash

   # Reset loaded modules (optional but recommended)
   module purge

   # Load required modules (EDIT THESE FOR YOUR HPC)
   module load python/3.X.Y

   # Activate the virtual environment
   source $HOME/PyAuto/bin/activate

   # Ensure Python can see your workspace
   export PYTHONPATH=$HOME:$HOME/PyAuto

Make the script executable:

::

   chmod +x activate.sh

.. note::

   - Some HPC systems do not use environment modules. If so, remove the
     ``module`` lines.
   - If you use Conda instead of ``venv``, activate your Conda environment
     here instead.

6. Activate the Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   source activate.sh

You should now see ``(PyAuto)`` at the start of your command prompt.

7. Install PyAutoGalaxy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   pip install autogalaxy

This installs PyAutoGalaxy and all required dependencies into the virtual
environment.

8. (Optional) Auto-Activate on Login
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you primarily use PyAutoGalaxy on this HPC, you can automatically activate
the environment when logging in.

Edit your shell configuration file:

::

   nano ~/.bashrc

Add:

::

   source $HOME/activate.sh

PyAutoGalaxy Workspace
--------------------

Your workspace mirrors the structure you use on your laptop, but excludes
large datasets and output directories.

On the HPC, this typically lives in:

::

   $HOME/autogalaxy_workspace

HPC-Specific Workspace Folder
------------------------------

The workspace contains an ``hpc`` folder (``scripts/guides/hpc``) with:

- ``batch_cpu/`` — SLURM submission scripts for CPU jobs
- ``batch_gpu/`` — SLURM submission scripts for GPU jobs
- ``sync`` — bash script for transferring files to and from the HPC
- ``sync.conf.example`` — configuration template for the sync script
- ``config/`` — HPC-specific configuration (e.g. ``general.yaml`` with
  ``hpc_mode: true``)

Data and Output Directories
---------------------------

Large datasets and PyAutoGalaxy output should be stored on a high-capacity
filesystem, often named something like:

- ``/scratch``
- ``/work``
- ``/data``
- ``/gpfs``
- ``/lustre``

Consult your HPC documentation to find the correct location.

Example Directory Setup (On HPC)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   cd /PATH/TO/LARGE_STORAGE/YOUR_USERNAME
   mkdir -p dataset
   mkdir -p output

Transferring Files: Manual rsync
---------------------------------

``rsync`` transfers files between your laptop and the HPC efficiently. The
most useful flags are:

- ``--update`` — only copy files that are newer than the destination
- ``-a`` — archive mode (preserves timestamps, permissions, symlinks)
- ``-z`` — compress data in transit (good for scripts and config; minimal
  benefit for ``.fits`` files)
- ``--partial`` — resume interrupted transfers instead of restarting

Uploading Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From your local workspace root:

::

   rsync --update -v -r scripts/ \
     YOUR_USERNAME@HPC_LOGIN_HOST:/PATH/TO/WORKSPACE/scripts/

Uploading Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   rsync --update -v -r dataset/ \
     YOUR_USERNAME@HPC_LOGIN_HOST:/PATH/TO/LARGE_STORAGE/YOUR_USERNAME/dataset/

Uploading a Single Dataset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   rsync --update -v -r dataset/example \
     YOUR_USERNAME@HPC_LOGIN_HOST:/PATH/TO/LARGE_STORAGE/YOUR_USERNAME/dataset/

Downloading Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   rsync --update -v -r \
     YOUR_USERNAME@HPC_LOGIN_HOST:/PATH/TO/LARGE_STORAGE/YOUR_USERNAME/output/ \
     ./output/

Transferring Files: Sync Script (Recommended)
----------------------------------------------

The ``sync`` script in ``scripts/guides/hpc/`` automates the above rsync
commands and handles push, pull, and dry-run in a single tool. It is the
preferred way to transfer files once you are comfortable with the manual
rsync approach.

Setup
^^^^^

Copy the example config and fill in your values:

::

   cp scripts/guides/hpc/sync.conf.example scripts/guides/hpc/sync.conf

Edit ``sync.conf``:

::

   # SSH host alias (from ~/.ssh/config) or user@hostname
   HPC_HOST=my_hpc

   # Base directory on the HPC under which your projects sit
   HPC_BASE=/scratch/YOUR_USERNAME

   # Project name on the HPC (defaults to local folder name)
   PROJECT_NAME=autogalaxy_workspace

``sync.conf`` is gitignored and stays on your local machine only.

Usage
^^^^^

Run from the workspace root:

::

   bash scripts/guides/hpc/sync push     # upload code, config, and data
   bash scripts/guides/hpc/sync pull     # download results
   bash scripts/guides/hpc/sync sync     # push then pull (default)
   bash scripts/guides/hpc/sync status   # dry run — show what would transfer

The script uses different rsync strategies per directory type:

- **Code and config** (``scripts/``, ``slam_pipeline/``, ``config/``) —
  ``--update``: changed files are overwritten, new files are added.
- **Dataset** — ``--ignore-existing``: any ``.fits`` file already on the HPC
  is never re-transferred, which avoids checksumming a large archive on
  every sync.
- **Output** — ``--update``: only files newer on the HPC are pulled down,
  and the large ``search_internal/`` sampler state is excluded automatically.

.. note::

   ``$HPC_BASE/$PROJECT_NAME`` in ``sync.conf`` is equivalent to
   ``$PROJECT_PATH`` used inside the SLURM batch scripts, so activation
   and script paths stay consistent.

Submitting Jobs: CPU
---------------------

SLURM jobs are submitted with ``sbatch``. Before submitting, set
``PROJECT_PATH`` so the batch script can find your workspace:

::

   export PROJECT_PATH=/PATH/TO/LARGE_STORAGE/YOUR_USERNAME/autogalaxy_workspace
   sbatch scripts/guides/hpc/batch_cpu/submit

The example CPU script is at ``scripts/guides/hpc/batch_cpu/submit``. The
key SLURM directives are:

- ``--partition=cpu`` — submit to the CPU partition (name varies by HPC)
- ``--cpus-per-task=8`` — number of CPU cores per job; increase for faster
  Nautilus sampling
- ``--mem=64gb`` — memory per job; increase for large pixelized reconstructions
- ``--time=18:00:00`` — wall-clock time limit; job is killed if it overruns
- ``--array=0-2`` — launch one job per dataset; SLURM sets
  ``$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`` to 0, 1, 2 in separate jobs

The array index selects the dataset:

::

   datasets=(dataset_0 dataset_1 dataset_2)
   dataset="${datasets[$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID]}"

This is the standard pattern for fitting many lenses simultaneously: each
array job is independent, runs on its own CPU allocation, and fits a
different dataset.

JAX and thread pinning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two environment variables tell JAX to use the CPU backend and prevent it
from attempting to use a GPU that is not allocated to this job:

::

   export JAX_PLATFORM_NAME=cpu
   export JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu

The thread-pinning block sets every linear-algebra library to use exactly
the number of CPUs SLURM allocated, preventing threads from overloading
the node:

::

   THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK
   export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=$THREADS
   export MKL_NUM_THREADS=$THREADS
   export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$THREADS
   ...

Submitting Jobs: GPU
---------------------

The GPU script at ``scripts/guides/hpc/batch_gpu/submit`` uses the same
array-job pattern but requests a GPU instead of extra CPUs.

Key differences from the CPU script:

- ``--partition=gpu`` — submit to the GPU partition
- ``--gres=gpu:1`` — request one GPU per job
- ``--cpus-per-task=1`` — only one CPU core is needed; the GPU handles
  parallelism
- ``--mem=32gb`` — GPU jobs typically need less host memory than large
  multi-CPU jobs
- No ``JAX_PLATFORM_NAME`` override — JAX auto-detects and uses the GPU
- No CPU thread-pinning block — not needed when a GPU is doing the work
- ``nvidia-smi`` — prints GPU information to the log at job start, useful
  for confirming the correct GPU was allocated

Submit with:

::

   export PROJECT_PATH=/PATH/TO/LARGE_STORAGE/YOUR_USERNAME/autogalaxy_workspace
   sbatch scripts/guides/hpc/batch_gpu/submit

.. note::

   GPU jobs use JAX with ``use_jax=True`` in the analysis object, which is
   already the default in PyAutoGalaxy. No code changes are required to switch
   from CPU to GPU — only the batch script changes.

Monitoring Jobs
---------------

After submitting, standard SLURM commands apply:

::

   squeue -u YOUR_USERNAME          # list your running and pending jobs
   scancel JOB_ID                   # cancel a job
   sacct -j JOB_ID --format=...     # inspect a completed job

Output and error logs are written to ``batch_cpu/output/`` and
``batch_cpu/error/`` (or ``batch_gpu/``) with filenames containing the
job and array index, making it easy to trace a specific dataset failure.

Next Steps
----------

- Read ``example_cpu_and_gpu.py`` in this folder for a detailed Python walkthrough
  of how paths, datasets, and Nautilus are configured for HPC runs.
- Adapt ``batch_cpu/submit`` or ``batch_gpu/submit`` for your HPC partition
  names, memory requirements, and dataset list.
- Use ``scripts/guides/hpc/sync`` for day-to-day file transfer once you
  have filled in ``sync.conf``.

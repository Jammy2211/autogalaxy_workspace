        "\n",

        "irregular and asymmetric morphological of galaxies (e.g. isophotal twists, an ellipticity which varies radially).\n",
        "Shapelets can capture some of these features and can therefore better represent the emission of complex galaxies.\n",
        "\n",
        "The shapelet model can be composed in a way that has fewer non-linear parameters than an elliptical Sersic. In this\n",
        "example, the ~20 shapelets which represent the `bulge` of that are composed in a model corresponding to just\n",

        "\n",
        "- The linear algebra used to solve for the `intensity` of each shapelet has to allow for negative values of intensity\n",
        "in order for shapelets to work. Negative surface brightnesses are unphysical, and are often inferred in a shapelet\n",
        "decomposition, for example if the true galaxy has structure that cannot be captured by the shapelet basis.\n",

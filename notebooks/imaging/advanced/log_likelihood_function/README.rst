The ``log_likelihood_function`` folder contains example scripts showing step-by-step visual guides to how likelihoods
are evaluated in **PyAutoGalaxy**.

Files (Beginner)
----------------

- ``parametric.py``: The likelihood function of a parametric fit, which uses an elliptical Sersic to represent the galaxy.
- ``pixelized.py``: The likelihood function of a pixelized reconstruction, which uses a regularized pixelization to non-parametrically fit the galaxy.
- ``contributor_guide.py``: URL links to every package, module and function called to perform likelihood evaluations for contributors.

        "Modeling Features: Multi Gaussian Expansion\n",
        "===========================================\n",
        "\n",
        "A multi Gaussian expansion (MGE) decomposes the galaxy light into ~15-100 Gaussians, where\n",
        "the `intensity` of every Gaussian is solved for via a linear algebra using a process called an \"inversion\"\n",
        "(see the `light_parametric_linear.py` feature for a full description of this).\n",
        "\n",
        "This script fits a light model which uses an MGE consisting of 60 Gaussians. It is fitted to simulated data\n",
        "where the galaxy's light has asymmetric and irregular features, which fitted poorly by symmetric light\n",
        "profiles like the `Sersic`.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Advantages__\n",
        "\n",
        "Symmetric light profiles (e.g. elliptical Sersics) may leave significant residuals, because they fail to capture\n",
        "irregular and asymmetric morphological of galaxies (e.g. isophotal twists, an ellipticity which varies radially).\n",
        "An MGE fully captures these features and can therefore much better represent the emission of complex galaxies.\n",
        "\n",
        "The MGE model can be composed in a way that has fewer non-linear parameters than an elliptical Sersic. In this example,\n",
        "two separate groups of Gaussians are used to represent the `bulge` and `disk` of the lens, which in total correspond\n",
        "to just N=6 non-linear parameters (a `bulge` and `disk` comprising two linear Sersics has N=10 parameters).\n",
        "\n",
        "The MGE model parameterization is also composed such that neither the `intensity` parameters or any of the\n",
        "parameters controlling the size of the Gaussians (their `sigma` values) are non-linear parameters sampled by Nautilus.\n",
        "This removes the most significant degeneracies in parameter space, making the model much more reliable and efficient\n",
        "to fit.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, not only does an MGE fit more complex galaxy morphologies, it does so using fewer non-linear parameters\n",
        "in a much simpler non-linear parameter space which has far less significant parameter degeneracies!\n",
        "\n",
        "__Disadvantages__\n",
        "\n",
        "To fit an MGE model to the data, the light of the ~15-75 or more Gaussian in the MGE must be evaluated and compared\n",
        "to the data. This is slower than evaluating the light of ~2-3 Sersic profiles, producing slower computational run\n",
        "times (although the simpler non-linear parameter space will speed up the fit overall).\n",
        "\n",
        "For many science cases, the MGE can also be a less intuitive model to interpret than a Sersic profile. For example,\n",
        "it is straight forward to understand how the effective radius of a Sersic profile relates to a galaxy's size,\n",
        "or the serisc index relates to its concentration. The results of an MGE are less intuitive, and require more\n",
        "thought to interpret physically.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Positive Only Solver__\n",
        "\n",
        "Many codes which use linear algebra typically rely on a linear algabra solver which allows for positive and negative\n",
        "values of the solution (e.g. `np.linalg.solve`), because they are computationally fast.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is problematic, as it means that negative surface brightnesses values can be computed to represent a galaxy's\n",
        "light, which is clearly unphysicag. For an MGE, this produces a positive-negative \"ringing\", where the\n",
        "Gaussians alternate between large positive and negative values. This is clearly undesirable and unphysicag.\n",
        "\n",
        "**PyAutoGalaxys** uses a positive only linear algebra solver which has been extensively optimized to ensure it is as fast\n",
        "as positive-negative solvers. This ensures that all light profile intensities are positive and therefore physicag.\n",

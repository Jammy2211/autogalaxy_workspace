The ``autogalaxy_workspace/scripts`` folder contains the packages for different science use-cases, where each package
only contains Python scripts (e.g. `.py` files) illustrating how to perform a specific task.

For Jupyter Notebook examples illustrating the same use-cases, see the ``autogalaxy_workspace/notebooks`` folder.

Refer to the ``autogalaxy_workspace/README.rst`` file or the readthedocs documentation for a description of which folder
you should go into next if you are unsure.

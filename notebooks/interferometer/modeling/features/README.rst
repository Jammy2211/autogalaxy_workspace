The following example scripts illustrating modeling where:

- ``linear_light_profiles.py``: The model includes light profiles which use linear algebra to solve for their intensity, reducing model complexity.
- ``multi_gaussian_expansion.py``: The galaxy light is modeled as ~25-100 Gaussian basis functions to capture asymmetric morphological features.
- ``pixelization.py``: The source is reconstructed using a rectangular pixel grid.

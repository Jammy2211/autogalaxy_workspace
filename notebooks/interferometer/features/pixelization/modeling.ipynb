        "This script fits a galaxy model that uses a pixelization to reconstruct the galaxy\u2019s light. It employs a\n",

        "This example fits the dataset with 273 visibilities used throughout the workspace, so the modeling runs in under 10\n",

        "__Advantages__\n",
        "\n",
        "Many galaxies exhibit complex, asymmetric, and irregular morphologies. Such structures cannot be well approximated by\n",
        "analytic light profiles such as a S\u00e9rsic profile, or even combinations of multiple S\u00e9rsic components. Pixelizations are\n",
        "therefore required to accurately reconstruct this irregular galaxy light.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even alternative basis-function approaches, such as shapelets or multi-Gaussian expansions, struggle to accurately\n",
        "reconstruct galaxies with highly complex morphologies or multiple distinct components.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pixelized galaxy models are also essential for robustly constraining detailed components of a galaxy\u2019s light\n",
        "distribution. By fitting all of the galaxy light, they reduce degeneracies between different components of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, many science applications aim to study the galaxy itself in detail, in order to learn about distant and\n",
        "intrinsically faint galaxies. Pixelizations reconstruct the intrinsic galaxy emission, enabling detailed studies of\n",
        "galaxy structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "For CCD imaging, a disadvantage of pixelized reconstructions is they are the most computationally expensive\n",
        "modeling approach. However, for interferometer datasets, the way that JAX and GPUs can exploit the sparsity in the\n",
        "linear algebra means pixelized reconstructions are both significantly faster than other approaches (E.g.\n",
        "light profiles) and can scale to millions of visibilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Disadvantages__\n",
        "\n",
        "Galaxy modeling with pixelizations is conceptually more complex. There are additional failure modes, such as\n",
        "solutions where the galaxy is reconstructed in an unphysical configuration. These issues are discussed in detail\n",
        "later in the workspace.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a result, learning to successfully fit galaxy models with pixelizations typically requires more time and experience\n",
        "than the simpler modeling approaches introduced elsewhere in the workspace.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Positive Only Solver__\n",
        "\n",
        "Many codes which use linear algebra typically rely on a linear algabra solver which allows for positive and negative\n",
        "values of the solution (e.g. `np.linalg.solve`), because they are computationally fast.\n",
        "\n",
        "This could be problematic, as it means that negative surface brightnesses values can be computed to represent a galaxy's\n",
        "light, which is clearly unphysical. For a pixelizaiton, this often produces negative pixels which over-fit\n",
        "the data, producing unphysical solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "For CCD imaging datsets pixelized reconstructions use a positive-only solver, meaning that every pixel\n",
        "is only allowed to reconstruct positive flux values. This ensures that the reconstruction is physical and\n",
        "that we don't reconstruct negative flux values that don't exist in the real galaxy.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, for interferometer datasets this positive-only solver is often disabled, because negative pixel values\n",
        "can be observed from the measurement process. All interferometer examples therefore disable the positive only solver,\n",
        "but you may want to consider if using the positive-only solver is appropriate for your dataset.\n",

        "Pixelized galaxy models are also essential for robustly constraining detailed components of a galaxy\u2019s light\n",

        "\n",
        "Finally, many science applications aim to study the galaxy itself in detail, in order to learn about distant and\n",

        "galaxy structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "For CCD imaging, a disadvantage of pixelized galaxy reconstructions is they are the most computationally expensive\n",
        "modeling approach. However, for interferometer datasets, the way that JAX and GPUs can exploit the sparsity in the\n",
        "linear algebra means pixelized galaxy reconstructions are both significantly faster than other approaches (E.g.\n",

        "\n",

        "__Positive Only Solver__\n",

        "\n",
        "This could be problematic, as it means that negative surface brightnesses values can be computed to represent a galaxy's\n",
        "light, which is clearly unphysical. For a pixelizaiton, this often produces negative pixels which over-fit\n",
        "the data, producing unphysical solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "For CCD imaging datsets pixelized galaxy reconstructions use a positive-only solver, meaning that every pixel\n",
        "is only allowed to reconstruct positive flux values. This ensures that the reconstruction is physical and\n",
        "that we don't reconstruct negative flux values that don't exist in the real galaxy.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, for interferometer datasets this positive-only solver is often disabled, because negative pixel values\n",
        "can be observed from the measurement process. All interferometer examples therefore disable the positive only solver,\n",

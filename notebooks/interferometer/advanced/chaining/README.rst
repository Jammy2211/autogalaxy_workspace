The ``chaining`` folder contains examples scripts illustrating the non-linear search chaining feature for interferometer datasets.

The API for search chaining is the same irrespective of the dataset fitted. Therefore, please refer to the folder
`autogalaxy_workspace/*/interferometer/chaining` for more example scripts, which can be copy and pasted
into scripts which model interferometer data via chaining.

The ``multi/preparation`` folder contains example scripts preparing imaging / interferometer data for
multi-data fitting.

Data preparation steps are the same as detailed in the ``imaging`` and ``interferometer`` folders,
therefore the guides in these folders should be consulted for a detailed description of the steps.

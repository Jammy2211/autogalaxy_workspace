        "f the light profile has a very steep gradient in intensity from one edge of the pixel to the other, like a Sersic\n",
        "profile does towards its centre, over sampling is necessary to evaluate to total emission observed in that pixel\n",
        "correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "This example demonstrates how to change the over sampling used to compute the surface brightness of every image-pixel,\n",

        "model of its image.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Benefit**: Higher level of over sampling provide a more accurate estimate of the surface brightness in every image-pixel.\n",
        "**Downside**: Higher levels of over sampling require longer calculations and higher memory usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "Over sampling is applied separately to the light profiles which compute the surface brightness of the lens galaxy,\n",

The ``imaging`` folder contains example scripts showing how to analyse galaxies with
using ellipse isophote fitting.

New users should read the ``start_here`` example, which gives an overview of all examples in the folder.

The ``modeling`` example performs lens modeling but only give a brief overview of how to analyse and interpret the
results a lens model fit.

A full guide to result analysis is given at ``autolens_workspace/*/guides/results``.

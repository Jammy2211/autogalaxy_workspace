    " reconstructs a galaxy (and therefore image) which fully accounts for the telescope optics and effect of the PSF.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2) You may be familiar with image sub-gridding, which splits each image-pixel into a sub-pixel (if you are not \n",
    " familiar then feel free to checkout the optional **HowToGalaxy** tutorial on sub-gridding. If a sub-grid is used, it is \n",
    " the mapping between every sub-pixel -pixel that is computed and used to perform the inversion. This prevents \n",
    " aliasing effects degrading the image reconstruction. By default **PyAutoGalaxy** uses sub-gridding of degree 4x4.\n",

        " 2) These grids are combined with light profiles to compute images and other quantities.\n",
        " 3) Profiles are grouped together to make galaxies.\n",
        " 4) Collections of galaxies (at the same redshift) can be made..\n",
        " 5) The Universe's cosmology can be input into this `Galaxies` to convert its units to kiloparsecs.\n",
        " 6) The galaxies's image can be used to simulate galaxy `Imaging` like it was observed with a real telescope.\n",
        " 7) This data can be fitted, so to as quantify how well a model galaxy system represents the observed image.\n",
